# Sprint Plan: 2025-12-30 to 2026-01-06

**Goal:** Address remaining code review issues - Security, Architecture, and Features

---

## Core Development Requirements

**MANDATORY for all sprints - no exceptions:**

### 1. TDD-First (Test-Driven Development)
```
RED    → Write failing test FIRST
GREEN  → Write MINIMAL code to pass
REFACTOR → Improve without breaking tests
```
- Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation
- No code without a failing test first
- Test coverage ≥ 80% for new code

### 2. SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: One class = one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **I**nterface Segregation: Many specific interfaces > one general
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. Dependency Injection (DI)
- All dependencies injected via constructor
- Use DI container for service resolution
- No `new` keyword in business logic
- Mock dependencies in tests

### 4. Clean Code
- Meaningful, descriptive names
- Small functions (<20 lines)
- No magic numbers/strings
- No duplication (DRY)
- Self-documenting code

### 5. No Over-Engineering
- YAGNI: Don't build what you don't need NOW
- Solve the current problem, not hypothetical future ones
- Simple solutions > clever solutions
- No premature optimization
- No unnecessary abstractions

## Architecture Notes

### Plugin Architecture
Payments and other extensible features use a **plugin pattern**:
- Abstract base interface defines contract
- Concrete implementations as plugins
- Registry for plugin discovery
- Easy to add new providers without core changes
