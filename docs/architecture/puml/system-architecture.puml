note right of api
    Headless REST API
    - JWT Authentication

note right of paypal
    Payment providers send
    webhook notifications for:
    - Payment completed
    - Subscription renewed
    - Payment failed
    - Refund processed
end note

note bottom of event_bus
    **Event-Driven Architecture**
    - Webhooks → Domain Events
    - EventBus dispatches to handlers
    - Handlers invoke services
    - Decoupled, async processing
end note

note bottom of plugin_mgr
    **Plugin System**
    - Provider-agnostic payments
    - Extensible via plugins
    - StripePlugin, PayPalPlugin
    - ManualPaymentPlugin
