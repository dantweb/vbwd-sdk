title Uncertainty Principle in LLMs

rectangle "Temperature T" as temp
rectangle "Softmax" as softmax
rectangle "Entropy H" as entropy
rectangle "Semantic Spread S" as spread
rectangle "Product: DH x DS >= 0.5" as product

temp --> softmax
softmax --> entropy
softmax --> spread
entropy --> product
spread --> product

note right of product
  Cannot minimize both:
  - Low T: Low DH, High DS
  - High T: High DH, Low DS

  Analogous to:
  Dx * Dp >= h/2
end note
